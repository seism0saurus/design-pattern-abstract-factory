# Design Pattern: Abstrct Factory

This is a simple example of the abstract factory design pattern. I wrote a blog post about it:
https://seism0saurus.de/design-pattern-abstract-factory.html (German)

The code is separated into two parts. The before package shows an implementation without the pattern. The after package
shows the implementation of an abstract factory to create credit cards.
